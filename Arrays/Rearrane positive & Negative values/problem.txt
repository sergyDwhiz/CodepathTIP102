Implement a function that rearranges elements in a list so that all
negative elements appear to the left and all positive elements
(including zero) appear to the right. Itâ€™s important to note that maintaining the
original sorted order of the input list is not required for this task.

input = [12, 6, 7, 8, -3, 6, -9, 0, -2]
output = [-2, -3, -9, 12, 6, 7, 8, 0]
