We're given a sorted list, nums, containing positive integers only.
We have to rearrange the list so that when returned, the 0th  index of the list will have the largest number, the
1st index will have the smallest number, the 2nd  index will have the second largest number, the
3rd  index will have the second smallest number, and so on.


In the end, weâ€™ll have the largest remaining numbers in descending order and the smallest in ascending
order at even and odd positions, respectively.
