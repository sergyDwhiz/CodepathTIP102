An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integers nums. Return true if nums is a special array, otherwise, return false.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: true

Explanation:

There is only one element. So the answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,4]

Output: true

Explanation:

There is only two pairs: (2,1) and (1,4), and both of them contain numbers with different parity. So the answer is true.
