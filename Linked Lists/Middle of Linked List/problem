Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node. This happens when the length of the list is even, and the second middle node occurs at
length/2. . Otherwise, if the length of the list is odd, the middle node occurs at
(length/2) + 1
