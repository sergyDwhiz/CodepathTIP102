Given the heads of two linked lists, head1 and head2, as inputs. Implement the union and intersection functions for the linked lists.
The order of elements in the output lists doesn’t matter.

Here’s how you will implement the functions:

## Union: This function will take two linked lists as input and return a new linked list containing all the unique elements.

## Intersection: This function will take two linked lists as input and return all the common elements between them as a new linked list.
