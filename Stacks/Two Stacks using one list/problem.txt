Design a data structure TwoStacks, that represents two stacks using a single list, where both stacks share the same list for storing elements.

The following operations must be supported:

push1(value): Takes an integer value and inserts it into the first stack.

push2(value): Takes an integer value and inserts it into the second stack.

pop1(): Removes the top element from the first stack and returns it.

pop2(): Removes the top element from the second stack and returns it.
