Design a data structure TwoStacks, that represents two stacks using a single list, where both stacks share the same list for storing elements.

The following operations must be supported:

push1(value): Takes an integer value and inserts it into the first stack.

push2(value): Takes an integer value and inserts it into the second stack.

pop1(): Removes the top element from the first stack and returns it.

pop2(): Removes the top element from the second stack and returns it.

Time complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1)
because all operations access array indices directly without resizing.

Space complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n)
, where n is the fixed size of the array used to implement the two stacks.
